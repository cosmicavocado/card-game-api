## User Stories

**As a player, I want to...**

- Add a name so that I can be uniquely identified while playing
- Draw up to 10 cards so that I have a full hand of 10 cards
- Draw a prompt so I can judge the responses
- Play a card so my response can be judged
- Choose winning card so that the winning player can be awarded a point
- See player scores so that I can keep track of who is winning
- See a message announcing the winning player so that all players know who won
- Create a custom card so I can personalize the game
- Update a custom card so I can make changes
- Delete a custom card so I can remove cards from the custom card pool
- Reset the game so that I donâ€™t have to reload the application just to begin a new game
